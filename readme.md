# Pomodoro Timer #

## What is the Pomodoro Technique? ##

The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity method. Francesco Cirillo developed the technique in 1992 as a way to get more studying done. The most basic way to use the Pomodoro Technique is as follows:

1. Choose a task to be accomplished

2. Set the Pomodoro (or timer) to 25 minutes

3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper

4. Take a short break (_e.g._, for 5 minutes)

5. Every 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (_e.g._, for 30 minutes)

## What does this web app do? ##

This web app provides a simple timer to use with the Pomodoro Technique. Each Pomodoro is set to 25 minutes; then, after a Pomodoro is completed, the timer is automatically set to 5 minutes for a short break. After 4 Pomodoros, the timer is automatically set to 30 minutes for a longer break.

Note: Refreshing the page will cause the app to "forget" how many Pomodoros the user has already completed, and the user will have to start from the first Pomodoro again.

## Future Updates ##

Future updates will include the following features:

* A pause button to temporarily stop the timer

* A widget that keeps track of how many Pomodoros the user has completed

* A settings widget that allows the user to customize certain features (_e.g._, the sound that plays after the timer ends, the amount of time for long breaks, etc.)

* An about widget that provides users with basic information about the Pomodoro Technique
